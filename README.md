A series of meetups about building and publishing interactive
applications in R.

## Syllabus

We’ll loosely follow the book [Mastering
Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) by Hadley Wickham. Each item in
this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub
[release](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.shiny/releases) that
preserves a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was shown during
thee meetup.

### Your first Shiny app

This meetup mostly covers [Chapter
1](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-app.html): Your first Shiny app:

Objective:

-   Understand what are the major pieces of an app and how they fit
    together.

### A use case of a shiny app for 2DII

This meetup takes a step back to motivate the use of shiny by showing a
use case of a shiny app for 2DII. From the many reasons why people use
shiny, this meetup covers only one – for more see the
[Preface](https://mastering-shiny.org/preface.html) of [Mastering
Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/).

Objective:

-   Understand why people use shiny via a concrete example.

### Basic UI and Basic reactivity

This meetup covers key elements of the section [Basic
UI](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-ui.html) and an introduction to
[Basic reactivity](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html) –
which we’ll follow in later meetups.

Objective:

-   Understand the common structure of the input functions.
-   Understand the mapping between input and output functions, and the
    need for a render functions.

### Next (tentative)

-   Introduction
    -   Basic reactivity (continued).
-   Shiny in action
